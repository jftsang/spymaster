This is a remake of Richard Bartle's game 
[Spymaster](https://www.youhaventlived.com/spymaster/), rewritten with a
Python backend. 

Spymaster is based on [Goofspiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goofspiel),
a classic game of bluffing and double-bluffing.

It's my attempt at writing a multiplayer browser game.
